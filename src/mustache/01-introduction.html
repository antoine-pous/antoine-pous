<h2>Hi there 👋</h2>
<p>
  My name is Antoine POUS, a self-taught developer from
  <img src="https://image.flaticon.com/icons/svg/197/197560.svg" width="13"/> <b>Lille, France</b>. I'm currently developing
  games, bots and automatons.

  I love discovering new technologies/stuff, taking part to open source projects and helping developers to enhance their
  skills and codebase.

  Since few years I became CTO. I strongly love this role!
